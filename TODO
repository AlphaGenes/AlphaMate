* Generic way of adding rewards/penalties
  - individual level
  - pair/mating level (progeny dominance, cross variance, missing data on some pairs
    should have "zero" weight?)

* MOET, JIVET, ... any other reproductive technoquies?

* Any other biotechnologies?

* Costs

* Update/finalise manual

* Parallelize differential evolution algorithm?
  - for this to happen we would have to convert criterion subroutine into a
    function, i.e., there would be no global variables. NOTE: memory usage will multiply
    with the number of processors!!!

* Stop optimisation and restart?
  - checkpointing trick (catch kill command, save current state, and stop)
