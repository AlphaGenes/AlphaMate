* Sort mating plan by contributions

* Generic way of adding costs (similar as with the generic individual/mating values)
  - individual level
  - mating level

          Criterion%Cost      = sum(Criterion%GenomeEdit(:)) * PAGEPar1Cost

* Input pedigree and/or genotype data to simplify creation of:
  - relationships
  - dominance in progeny
  - variance among progeny

* MOET, JIVET, ... any other reproductive technologies?
  - are these not covered with lifting the limit constraints on females?

* Any other biotechnologies?

* Update/finalise manual

* Parallelize differential evolution algorithm?
  - code in AlphaMate ready for this
  - need to figure out how to handle OMP flags and RNG in AlphaEvolve

  - is it worth it?

* Stop optimisation and restart?
  - checkpointing trick (catch kill command, save current state, and stop, enable
    restart from the saved state)
  - is it worth it?
