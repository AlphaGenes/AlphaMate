  - any good?

--- BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ---

* Random mating vs mating plan, i.e., mate allocation
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_proportional_fitting
* Future RelMat and realized CoaRate etc.

* coancestry summary on whole rel matrix or just triangle of it?

* How do we handle when nMat > nDam? Are we mating one dam with several sires?
* MOET, JIVET, ... any other reproductive technologies?
  - are these not covered with lifting the limit constraints on females?
* Any other biotechnologies?

* Enable several inbreeding targets to simplify exploring the Pareto frontier?

--- OTHER ---

* Update/finalise manual

* Cut precision in Frontier and Optimisation log files??? Or make it as an option?

* Sort mating plan by contributions

* Colnames and formats in AlphaMateSpec instead of AlphaMateSol? We have lots of AlphaMateSol, so
  would save some space and also intialise and assign methods do not carry this data over. would
  have to pass Spec to Log methods in AlphaEvolve, which we do already for many methods anyhow.

* Generic way of adding costs (similar as with the generic individual/mating values)
  - individual level
  - mating level
          Criterion%Cost      = sum(Criterion%GenomeEdit(:)) * PAGEPar1Cost

* Input pedigree and/or genotype data to simplify creation of:
  - relationships
  - dominance in progeny
  - variance among progeny

--- ALGORITHMIC CONSIDERATIONS ---

* Good/sensible starting point for optimisation?

Objectives: J(x)
  - max genetic gain
  - min f(coancestry) (is this objective or constraint?)
  - min/max f(inbreeding) (is this objective or constraint?)
  - ???

Design variables: x
  - number of matings: x_n
  - mate allocation: x_m (per mating or per progeny!?)
  - edits: x_e

Constraints (g(x) <= 0, h(x) = 0)
  - f(coancestry) (is this objective or constraint?) <= dC
  - f(inbreeding) (is this objective or constraint?) <= dF
  - ?min(x_n) <= x_n <= max(x_n) (integer!, can vary by gender)
  - ?x_m
  - sum(x_e) <= n_e

Bounds (side constraints)
  - ?min(x_n) <= x_n <= max(x_n) (integer!, can vary by gender)
  - ?x_m
  - x_e = {0, 1}

Merit function f(J(x), g(x), h(x))

Exterior penalty J(x) + rho * P(x), rho increases over time
  - quadratic P(x) = sum(g(x)^2) + sum(h(x)^2), might need very large rho to meet constraints
  - absolute  P(x) = sum(abs(g(x))) + sum(abs(h(x))), more manageable rho, but discontinuos derivatives when g(x) and/or h(x) are zero

Interior penalty (barrier method) J(x) + r * sum(-1 / g(x)) + rho * sum(h(x)^2)
  - r = barrier parameter (start as a large positive value and decreases)
  - only for inequality constraints
  - discontinuos at constraint boundaries

Constraints in GA
  - penalty
  - selection operator (do not select solutions that violate constraints)
  - problem representation (only allow for valid solutions)
  - repair

  - Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method (Das and Dennis, 1998)
    Das I. and Dennis J, “Normal-Boundary Intersection: A New Method for Generating Pareto Optimal Points in Multicriteria Optimization Problems”, SIAM Journal on Optimization, Vol. 8, No.3, 1998, pp. 631-657
    (generate solutions that are well-distributed)
    1. Perform single objective optimisations (J_i^star = J_i(x^star), i = 1, 2, ..., k)
    2. Define utopia point J^u = [J_1^star, J_2^star, ..., J_k^star]
    3. Utopia line between the anchor points
    4. Perform a series of optimisations along the line in even increments
    5. Evaluate which points are Pareto optimal

  - Adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method (Kim and Weck, 2005)
    Kim I.Y. and de Weck O.L., “Adaptive weighted-sum method for bi-objective optimization: Pareto front generation”, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 29 (2), 149-158, February 2005
    - Focuses on regions that are not well covered
    - Handles non-convex regions (in minimisation)
    - Less/no non-pareto solutions

--- COMPUTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ---

* Only partial sort/rank with ORDERPACK could speed up eval a lot.
  http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~diablo/#3.1

* Split components in the solution to simplify code and potentially speed it up

* Parallelisation via OpenMP
  Option A) parallelise differential evolution algorithm (parallel evaluation of solutions, is this needed?)
  Option B) parallelise multiple optimisation runs
    - of the same problem to avoid local minima? (and then run one more run with those initial values?)
    - of different optimisations run (initial modes, evaluate front !!! - NBI)

  - Some weblinks regarding parallel implementation
    * random_number() is slow as threads wait for each other to update RNG Seed, need separate streams!!!

* Stop optimisation and restart?
  - checkpointing trick (catch kill command, save current state, and stop, enable
    restart from the saved state)
  - is it worth it?

* Other optimisation algorithms?
  - Evolution strategies of OpenAI stohastically estimate gradients, but this is
    continuous optimisation (which I also do in AlphaMate through a hacked
    solution representation!)
