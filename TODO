DONE ModeMin
  - 90% trick?

TODO ModeMax
  - 90% trick?

TODO ModeDegree --> TargetDegree etc.
  - change Eval function?

TODO ModeRan
  - any good?

TODO ModeFrontier
  - broken at the moment (objective=0)
  - add also degree concept

* How do we handle when nMat > nDam? Are we mating one dam with several sires?
* MOET, JIVET, ... any other reproductive technologies?
  - are these not covered with lifting the limit constraints on females?
* Any other biotechnologies?

* Sort mating plan by contributions

* Good/sensible starting point for optimisation?

* Generic way of adding costs (similar as with the generic individual/mating values)
  - individual level
  - mating level

          Criterion%Cost      = sum(Criterion%GenomeEdit(:)) * PAGEPar1Cost

* Input pedigree and/or genotype data to simplify creation of:
  - relationships
  - dominance in progeny
  - variance among progeny

* Update/finalise manual

* Parallelize differential evolution algorithm?
  - code in AlphaMate ready for this
  - need to figure out how to handle OMP flags and RNG in AlphaEvolve

  - is it worth it?

* Stop optimisation and restart?
  - checkpointing trick (catch kill command, save current state, and stop, enable
    restart from the saved state)
  - is it worth it?
