* Generic way of adding rewards/penalties
  - individual level
  - pair/mating level (progeny dominance, cross variance, missing data on some pairs
    should have "zero" weight?)

* Input pedigree and/or genotype data to simplify creation of:
  - relationships
  - dominance in progeny
  - variance among progeny

* MOET, JIVET, ... any other reproductive technoquies?
  - are these not covered with lifting the limit constraints on females?

* Any other biotechnologies?

* Costs

* Update/finalise manual

* Parallelize differential evolution algorithm?
  - code in AlphaMate ready for this
  - need to figure out how to handle OMP flags and RNG in AlphaEvolve

* Stop optimisation and restart?
  - checkpointing trick (catch kill command, save current state, and stop, enable
    restart from the saved state)
