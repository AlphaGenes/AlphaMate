v0.3.0 2019-??-??
  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Added functionality to avoid reciprocal matings when gender is not relevant.

  * Added functionality to avoid repeated matings.

  * Mating plan has now additional info (the number of matings per parent and
    the number of repeated matings).

  * Specifications are now more thoroughly tested.

  * Specifications Limit{Male,Female}Contributions have been removed - you now only
    have to specify Limit{Male,Female}Contributions{Min,Max} to activate limits.

  * Sensible defaults are invoked for the number of parents and matings/crosses
    when these are not given. This is required for some specific uses, for example,
    to optimise a core diversity set.

  * Added an example that optimises a core diversity set.

  * Input data without variation is now allowed - a NOTE is given (instead of an ERROR).

  * Targets beyond limits are now reset to limits - a NOTE is given (instead of an ERROR).

  * Targets.txt file is now always produced - for any optimisation mode.

  * Added a note about flexibility to the manual.

  * Improved stability with some edge cases.

  BUGFIXES
  * In some edge cases written mating plan was wrong.

  * In some edge cases with limited specifications an error was thrown needlessly.

  * AlphaMate crashed when only selection criterion targets or coancestry targets
    were given. Now it properly maximises gain for given coancestry targets and
    minimises coancestry for given selection criterion targets.

v0.2.0 2018-11-02
  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Faster optimisation via parallelisation. The animal example is about 7x faster
    with 8 cores.

  * Faster data input/preparation. The animal example is ~3x faster. Larger cases
    will see more gain.

  * Infrastructure for single or double precision mode to further speed-up large cases.

  BUGFIXES
  * Now we properly set random number generator seed value for all run cases.

v0.1.1 2018-07-03
  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Improved handling of specifications LimitContributions and EqualizeContributions
    when gender is given, i.e., when limits are used for one gender and equalizing
    for the other gender.

  * Consolidated which optimisation modes are turned on with provided targets
    (criterion, coancestry, and/or inbreeding).

  BUGFIXES
  * Handle cases when the number of matings/crosses is larger than the number of
    individuals.

v0.1.0 2018-01-21
  * First public version
