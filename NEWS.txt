v0.3.0 2019-??-??
  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Added functionality to avoid reciprocal matings when gender is not relevant.

  * Added functionality to avoid repeated matings.

  * Mating plan has now additional info (the number of matings per parent and
    the number of repeated matings).

  * Specifications are now more thoroughly tested.

  * Specifications Limit{Male,Female}Contributions have been removed - you now only
    have to specify Limit{Male,Female}Contributions{Min,Max} to activate limits.

  * Sensible defaults are invoked for the number of parents and matings/crosses
    when these are not given. This is required for some specific uses, for example,
    to optimise a core diversity set.

  * Added an example that optimises a core diversity set.

  * We now allow input data without variation to cater for some specific use cases,
    but write a NOTE (instead of an ERROR).

  * Targets.txt file is now always produced - for any optimisation mode.

  * Added a note about flexibility to the manual.

  BUGFIXES
  * In some edge cases written mating plan was wrong.

  * In some edge cases with limited specifications an error was thrown needlessly.

v0.2.0 2018-11-02
  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Faster optimisation via parallelisation. The animal example is about 7x faster
    with 8 cores.

  * Faster data input/preparation. The animal example is ~3x faster. Larger cases
    will see more gain.

  * Infrastructure for single or double precision mode to further speed-up large cases.

  BUGFIXES
  * Now we properly set random number generator seed value for all run cases.

v0.1.1 2018-07-03
  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Improved handling of specifications LimitContributions and EqualizeContributions
    when gender is given, i.e., when limits are used for one gender and equalizing
    for the other gender.

  * Consolidated which optimisation modes are turned on with provided targets
    (criterion, coancestry, and/or inbreeding).

  BUGFIXES
  * Handle cases when the number of matings/crosses is larger than the number of
    individuals.

v0.1.0 2018-01-21
  * First public version
